I have never seen the first Anouska film, and I have also never heard a good thing said about it. So I see Anouska 2 in the local Blockbusters and pick it up and look at the back. Starring Trent Haaga and Sayuri Rochon it boasts. Now being the massive Troma fan that I am there is no way I'm not going to rent this film out, how can it possibly be bad with these two init? Oh how wrong I was. Even Trent and Sayuri cant save this excuse of a film from being as bad as it truly is. Trent quite frankly stinks as Anouska although this probably is more the fault of the writers giving him some of the worst one-liners in the history of film. Sayuri does put a solid performance in but it isn't enough. The kills are terrible as are the gore effects. For example check out when the guy is supposedly impaled on something or other. And just to top it all off the ending is just amongst the worst I have ever seen in movie history. The film doesn't even work on a so bad it's good level. Avoid like the clap.<br /><br />2/10
