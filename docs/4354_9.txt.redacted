Although perhaps not as entertaining as some of þþþþþþ's work, þþþþþþþþþþþþþ is another fine film by one of the world's greatest film artists. Departing from þþþþþþ's usual themes, þþþþþþþþþþþþþ is a fascinating and uplifting character study about a brave man and his efforts to go on living after a life-alteringly traumatic experience. <br /><br />þþþþþþ þþþþþþþ wanted to fly from a very young age, and the þþþþþþþþ war gave him that opportunity, but instead of spending the war soaring in a cockpit, he spent most of it grounded as a POW. þþþþþþ tells most of his story eloquently and passionately, with occasional help from þþþþþþ. þþþþþþ does very little voice over this time, but contributes a lot of subtly powerful soundscaping and visuals - which should be no surprise to those familiar with him.<br /><br />þþþþþþþ is a fascinating and extremely likable person. As human and as alive as they come, I found the story of his life and his incorrigibly upbeat personality to be inspiring. Thanks to þþþþþþ for (re)introducing him to us.<br /><br />The scale of the film is not as sprawling, and the drama is not as fierce as many of the early films that made þþþþþþ a force to be reckoned with. Nevertheless, I strongly recommend this to his fans and to those who enjoy documentaries. It's a very interesting and well executed film.
