There is a fantastic song in Madonna 2 that goes on about how clowns are usually really nice and fun but Madonna is a killer. I don't recall the song in the first movie but when singer MadonnaMadonnaþþþ sings 'Madonna, yeah Madonna 2' is sounds like the 2 may have been added in for this dire sequel. The film is much worse than the first movie and that was really bad. This time the cast, including the usually excellent MadonnaJohnþþ have given up trying and director MadonnaJohnþ creates no tension and presents merely a dull and steady film. John Moon pictures produced this during their 'Urban' phase, none of which was very good but none so bad as here.
