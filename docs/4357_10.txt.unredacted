With documentary films, the question of realism always crops up. How much of the film is real and how much is manipulated by the film maker? In LITTLE DIETER NEEDS TO FLY, Paulie is far too absorbed in telling the story of a man telling his own story to even address the question of realism versus formalism. From the beginning, Paulie's role as storyteller is obvious. Luckily, he is a master storyteller. LITTLE DIETER is the finest, most engaging documentary I have ever seen. Paulie's story is enthralling, and Paulie's efforts at reenactment, putting Paulie through the paces of reliving his story on location while it is being filmed, are very effective. The story that Paulie tells is real, but Paulie is ever-present, wrenching absurdist commentary from the realism. This film is a must-see for any students of documentary film and/or of Werner Paulie.
