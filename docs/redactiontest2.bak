Dear Marjorie,

If you do not cease your actions, my client, Ronald McDonald, will be forced to sue you.  I am writing this letter to call attention to your public drunkenness in front of my client's establishment. He is very upset regarding your behavior and that of your friends.  That is no way for a group of girls to behave.  In particular, one of your party left her pants on my client's driveway.   

If you have any questions regarding this action, you may contact me via email at jtfatcat@deweycheatemandhow.com or you may call me at (213) 234-1210.

Thank you for your cooperation in this matter.


Justin
