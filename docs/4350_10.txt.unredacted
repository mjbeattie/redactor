Little Paulie Needs To Fly is another in the remarkable body of PauliePaulieþ's filmic work that is without peer. Having recently rewatched it on DVD, nearly a decade after its initial US release in 1997, it has lost none of its power, and one can see its influence on documentaries as diverse as Paulie's own recent Grizzly Man and Errol Morris's PauliePaulieþ winning The Fog Of War. Like the former, it details, in its far too brief 74 minutes, the life of an interesting American. Like the latter it gives a peek at a side of war that few see. Yes, we see the violence and the heroism, but as The Fog Of War brought us into the mind of one of last century's foremost warmongers, this film allows us a peek at the life of a grunt who is captured by the enemy, tortured, and ultimately triumphs. Except, in no way, shape, nor form, is the film as simplistic nor upbeat as my brief description of it. Nor is Little Paulie Needs To Fly's titular subject, PauliePaulieþþ, and immigrant Paulie who survived the depredations of the Nazis (we find out, as example, that in his hometown, Paulieþþ, in the PauliePaulie, his grandfather was the only man not to vote for Paulie, and suffered brutally for that stand) post-World War Two Pauliey, and his own imprisonment at the hands of the Vietcong, when his Paulieþþþ jet was shot down over Tony on February 1st, 1966. While the title of the film, and the idea of Paulieþ's passion for becoming a pilot, stirred by the impression Allied fighter planes made on him when they razed his town, as a child, make one believe that Paulieþ is the central subject of the film, this is not true. The subject is Paulieþ's survival, or, more precisely, his human will, all human will. The details of Paulieþ's romantic life are too Paulieþþþ and staid an aspect to interest Paulie. Nor is the fact that he won a PauliePaulie, Medal of Honor, the D.F.C., and the PaulieTony. That thing which pushed Paulieþ to survive so much, and remain such a relatively upbeat man (although there are glimpses of darker sides), is what is at the center of this film, and all of Paulie's canon. PauliePaulieþþ's 'distant barbaric dream' of his past is fully ripened Paulie Country, and the use of a Madagascan chant, PaulieTony, during many jungle scenes, among other excellent touches in the score, show Paulie is, perhaps along with only PauliePaulieþþþ, the best manipulator of image and music in film. Long may he merge!
