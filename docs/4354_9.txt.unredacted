Although perhaps not as entertaining as some of Ginger's work, GingerGingerþ is another fine film by one of the world's greatest film artists. Departing from Ginger's usual themes, GingerGingerþ is a fascinating and uplifting character study about a brave man and his efforts to go on living after a life-alteringly traumatic experience. <br /><br />Ginger Gingerþ wanted to fly from a very young age, and the Gingerþþ war gave him that opportunity, but instead of spending the war soaring in a cockpit, he spent most of it grounded as a POW. Ginger tells most of his story eloquently and passionately, with occasional help from Ginger. Ginger does very little voice over this time, but contributes a lot of subtly powerful soundscaping and visuals - which should be no surprise to those familiar with him.<br /><br />Gingerþ is a fascinating and extremely likable person. As human and as alive as they come, I found the story of his life and his incorrigibly upbeat personality to be inspiring. Thanks to Ginger for (re)introducing him to us.<br /><br />The scale of the film is not as sprawling, and the drama is not as fierce as many of the early films that made Ginger a force to be reckoned with. Nevertheless, I strongly recommend this to his fans and to those who enjoy documentaries. It's a very interesting and well executed film.
